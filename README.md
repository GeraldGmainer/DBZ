# DBZ Prototype (2015)

A small Dragon Ball–inspired prototype developed in 2015.  
The project experiments with core gameplay systems such as movement, flight,
combat mechanics, abilities, and basic character interactions.  
Early versions were created in Unreal Engine 4 before shifting to Unity for faster iteration.
